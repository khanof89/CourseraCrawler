If you’re using a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Beautiful Soup with the system package manager:

> apt-get install python3-bs4

Beautiful Soup 4 is published through PyPi, so if you can’t install it with the system packager, you can install it with easy_install or pip. The package name is beautifulsoup4, and the same package works on Python 2 and Python 3. Make sure you use the right version of pip or easy_install for your Python version (in current cae it will be pip3 or easy_install3).

> pip3 install beautifulsoup4
